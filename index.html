  	  	    <p>With 3 rambunctious boys at home, it's hard to find any free time but when I can, I enjoy doing creative projects. I love to sew, crochet, and make jewelry as well as cook and bake. I also enjoy doing fun activities with my family. In the winter, we take the kids up north to go snowboarding, and in the summer, we soak up the sun by biking around the neighborhood for hours and hours.</p>
            <p>I have worked as a Quality Assurance Engineer at several companies around the Bay Area, including Secure Data In Motion, iHarvest, and Visa International. The most recent company was at LeapFrog Enterprises, where we created educational software for children. One of the many projects that I worked on was creating pen devices that were used with dot pages to read stories and sound out letters, all of which helped children learn how to read. I was employed at LeapFrog for 8 years and really enjoyed my time there.</p>
